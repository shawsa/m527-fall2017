\problem{1} Find the three cube roots of $64i$. \\

	\begin{align*}
		64i & = 64e^{\pi/2} = 64e^{-3\pi/2} = 64e^{5\pi/2} \\
		(64e^{\pi/2})^{1/3} & = 4(e^{\pi/2})^{1/3} \\
		& = 4(e^{\pi/6}) = 2\sqrt{3}+2i \\
		(64e^{-3\pi/2})^{1/3} & = 4(e^{-3\pi/2})^{1/3} \\
		& = 4(e^{-\pi/2}) = -4i \\
		(64e^{5\pi/2})^{1/3} & = 4(e^{5\pi/2})^{1/3} \\
		& = 4(e^{5\pi/6}) = -2\sqrt{3}+2i
	\end{align*}
	
	Thus 
	\begin{align*}
		4(e^{\pi/6}) &= 2\sqrt{3}+2i \\
		4(e^{-\pi/2}) &= -4i \\
		4(e^{5\pi/6}) &= -2\sqrt{3}+2i
	\end{align*}
	are the three cube roots of $64i$.

\problem{\# 3} Determine and graph the set given by $\pi < \vert z - 4 + 2i \vert < 3\pi$. \bigbreak

	This is the set of points within the circle of radius $3\pi$ centered at $4-2i$ but outside of the circle of radius $\pi$ with the same center.

\problem{4} Find all solutions of thte equation $\cos(z) = 4i$. \bigbreak

	\begin{align*}
		\cos(z) &= 4i \\
		\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{iz}+e^{-iz}) &= 4i \\
		e^{iz}+e^{-iz} &= 8i \\
		e^{2iz}+e^{0} &= 8ie^{iz} \\
		(e^{iz})^2 -8i e^{iz} + 1 & = 1 \\
		e^{iz} &= \frac{8i \pm \sqrt{-64 - 4}}{2} \\
		e^{iz} &= (4 \pm \sqrt{17})i \\
		e^{i(x+iy)} &= (4 \pm \sqrt{17})i \\
		e^{-y+xi} &= 0 + (4 \pm \sqrt{17})i \\
		e^{-y}\cos(x) + e^{-y}\sin(x)i &= 0 + (4 \pm \sqrt{17})i \\
	\end{align*}
	Since $e^{-y} \neq 0$, we can conclude that $\cos(x) = 0$ and thus $x = \tfrac{\pi}{2}+n\pi$ for $n \in \ZZ$. If $n$ is even then $\sin(x) = 1$ and 
	\begin{align*}
		e^{-y} & = (4 \pm \sqrt{17}) \\
		e^{-y} & = (4 + \sqrt{17}) \text{\ \ ($e^{-y}$ only assumes positive values)}\\
		y & = -\ln(4 + \sqrt{17})
	\end{align*} 
	If $n$ is odd, then $\sin(x) = -1$ and
	\begin{align*}
		-e^{-y} & = (4 \pm \sqrt{17}) \\
		-e^{-y} & = (4 - \sqrt{17}) \text{\ \ ($-e^{-y}$ only assumes negative values)}\\
		e^{-y} & = (\sqrt{17}-4) \text{\ \ ($-e^{-y}$ only assumes negative values)}\\
		y & = - \ln(\sqrt{17}-4)
	\end{align*}
	So $z = \tfrac{\pi}{2}+2m\pi -\ln(4 + \sqrt{17})i$ and $z = \tfrac{3\pi}{2}+2m\pi - \ln(\sqrt{17}-4)i$ where $m \in \ZZ$ are all of the values of $z$ such that $\cos(z) = 4i$.
